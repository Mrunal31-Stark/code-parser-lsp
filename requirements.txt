Optional: If you're running on Python 3.8 or below, you may need typing-extensions explicitly; for Python 3.9+, it's built-in.

If you want to be extra precise (e.g., for production or Docker setup), you can pin versions like this:

tree-sitter-languages==1.8.0
tree-sitter==0.20.1
pytest==7.4.0
typing-extensions==4.9.0

uuid is part of the Python standard library, so no need to install it explicitly unless you're using a package that wraps it.
